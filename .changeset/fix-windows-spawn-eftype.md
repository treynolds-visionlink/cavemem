Fix `spawn EFTYPE` on Windows and unblock installs on Windows end-to-end.

**Root cause**

The CLI's `process.argv[1]` (and everything `resolveCliPath()` derives from it) is the `.js` entry file, not a native executable. Node's `child_process.spawn` cannot exec a raw `.js` on Windows — it has no associated binfmt handler, so the launcher bubbles up `EFTYPE`. Every background code path that self-spawned the CLI — `cavemem start`, `cavemem restart`, `cavemem viewer`, and the hook auto-spawn in `@cavemem/hooks` — hit this, so the worker never started and hooks stayed degraded with no embeddings. The installers then wrote the same bad shape into IDE configs (`command: <cliPath.js>` for MCP servers; `"<cliPath.js> hook run …"` as a shell string for Claude Code hooks), so even opening Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode could not launch the CLI.

**Fix**

- Every internal `spawn(cli, [...])` now spawns `process.execPath` with the CLI path as the first arg — cross-platform and does not rely on the OS knowing how to exec a `.js`.
- `InstallContext` gains a required `nodeBin` field (populated with `process.execPath`). All five installers write `command: nodeBin, args: [cliPath, "mcp", ...]` instead of `command: cliPath, args: ["mcp"]`.
- The Claude Code installer's hook command strings are now `"<nodeBin>" "<cliPath>" hook run <name> --ide claude-code`, with paths wrapped via a new `shellQuote` helper so `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe` and `C:\Users\Some User\...\index.js` survive both cmd.exe and sh without splitting.
- Added a Windows-path regression test in `packages/installers/test/installers.test.ts` so the quoting stays correct.

**Upgrade note**

Existing Windows installs still have the broken shape written into `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, etc. After upgrading, run `cavemem install` (and `cavemem install --ide cursor`, etc.) once to rewrite those files with the corrected `nodeBin + cliPath` form. Nothing else changes for macOS and Linux users.
